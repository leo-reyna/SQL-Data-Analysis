# SQL Queries: AdventureWorks Part-I

The AdventureWorks OLTP database is designed to support standard online transaction processing scenarios for a fictional bicycle manufacturer named Adventure Works Cycles. These scenarios span across Manufacturing, Sales, Purchasing, Product Management, Contact Management, and Human Resources. AdventureWorks is prominently featured in code examples within SQL Server Books Online and accompanying samples available for download from the Microsoft SQL Server Samples and Community Projects home page. The database schema is carefully crafted to showcase and emphasize the diverse features of SQL Server.
