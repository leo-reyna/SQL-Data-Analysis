# How To Use Mathematical Expressions and Aggregate Functions in SQL
To practice many of the mathematical expression examples in this tutorial, youâ€™ll need a database and table loaded with sample data. If you do not have one ready to insert, you can read the following Connecting to MySQL and Setting up a Sample Database section to learn how to create a database and table. This tutorial will refer to this sample database and table throughout.
