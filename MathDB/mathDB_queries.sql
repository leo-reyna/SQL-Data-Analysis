--PEMDAS stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. 
--This term serves as a guideline for the order of operations necessary to solve more complex equations.
--SQL reads them left to right, and then values beginning from the inside to the outside. 
--For this reason, ensure your values within parentheses accurately capture the problem youâ€™re trying to solve.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Placement matters, consider the following the examples below uses the same three values and operators, but with a different parentheses placement, this produces a different result:
 
 SELECT (12 + 41) * 7 AS Result;
--Output 371

 SELECT 12 + (41 * 7) AS Result;
--Output 299
