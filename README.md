An exploration of using Mathematical Expressions and Aggregate Functions in SQL.

SQL allows you to use math in various ways. You can solve simple arithmetic problems, similar to using a calculator. SQL also enables you to perform complex analyses on real-world data, which can greatly influence business decisions. B-my understanding basic math operations and the order of operations, you can unlock a wide range of calculation possibilities. Additionally, when you combine these operations with aggregate functions, you can answer "what if" questions and gain insights that can aid in strategic planning or decision making. SQL offers a powerful toolset for analyzing data and making informed choices.
