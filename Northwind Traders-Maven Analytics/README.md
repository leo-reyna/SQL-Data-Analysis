# Northwind Traders Challenge by Maven Analytics

This is my SQL submission to the Maven Analytics Northwind Challenge.
This repository has sales & order data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious gourmet food supplier, including information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees tables in .csv format.  
This challenge was presented by [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io//) in May 2023.

| DATA STRUCTURE  | # OF RECORDS | # OF FIELDS  |
| --------------- |:------------:| :----------: |
| Multiple tables  | 2,985        |28            |

Maven Analytics recommended analysis:

* Are there any noticable sales trends over time?
* Which are the best and worst selling products?
* Can you identify any key customers?
* Are shipping costs consistent across providers?

One of the main goals of this project is to design a high-level Key Performance Indicator (KPI) reporting system using SQL for the executive team. This reporting system aims to offer a rapid and comprehensive insight into the company's performance across essential domains, such as:

## Sales Trends

* Product performance
* Key customers
* Shipping costs
* Orders Overview
